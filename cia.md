### Key:

- **Confidentiality (C):** Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
- **Integrity (I):** Ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and protected from unauthorized modification.
- **Availability (A):** Ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.

### Summary:

- **Confidentiality:** Focused on protecting sensitive data, particularly for assets like authentication credentials, user data, and cryptographic keys.
- **Integrity:** A critical aspect for most assets to ensure that data, metadata, and software are not tampered with. This is crucial for update-related data to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Availability:** Essential for systems that need to function reliably, like update servers, backup and recovery mechanisms, and communication channels.

This table provides a clear view of how each asset aligns with the CIA triad, helping prioritize security measures and focus on maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical components in the OTA update ecosystem.

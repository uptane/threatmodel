# Uptane Specific Assets

Uptane is a framework specifically designed to enhance the security of over-the-air (OTA) updates for automotive and other embedded systems. It provides mechanisms to protect against various attacks, such as those targeting the update process itself or the servers involved in distributing updates. Here are additional assets related to Uptane that should be included in your security threat model:

### 1. **Director Repository**
   - **Description:** The server responsible for signing and distributing update metadata that directs devices to the appropriate update files.
   - **Importance:** Protecting this repository is critical, as it ensures that devices only receive authorized updates and prevents attackers from distributing malicious updates.

### 2. **Image Repository**
   - **Description:** The server that stores the actual update files (firmware, software images) and associated metadata.
   - **Importance:** Securing this repository ensures that the stored update files cannot be tampered with or replaced by unauthorized parties.

### 3. **Root Metadata**
   - **Description:** Metadata that contains the top-level cryptographic keys and policies for the Uptane system, including roles and their public keys.
   - **Importance:** This metadata is foundational for the entire update security infrastructure; compromising it could undermine the trust model of the OTA system.

### 4. **Targets Metadata**
   - **Description:** Metadata that specifies which images (updates) are available and the conditions under which they should be installed.
   - **Importance:** Protecting this metadata ensures that only authorized and vetted updates are installed on the devices.

### 5. **Snapshot Metadata**
   - **Description:** Metadata that provides a cryptographic hash of the latest metadata files to ensure the consistency of the update.
   - **Importance:** This ensures that an attacker cannot replay old, potentially vulnerable updates or metadata.

### 6. **Timestamp Metadata**
   - **Description:** Metadata that provides a cryptographic hash and timestamp of the latest snapshot metadata, ensuring freshness and preventing rollback attacks.
   - **Importance:** Protecting this metadata prevents attackers from tricking devices into accepting stale or outdated updates.

### 7. **Delegation Metadata**
   - **Description:** Metadata that allows a primary role to delegate responsibilities (such as signing images) to other roles.
   - **Importance:** Ensures that only authorized parties can sign and approve updates, which helps in managing large fleets of devices.

### 8. **Compromise-Resilient Keys**
   - **Description:** Cryptographic keys with shorter lifespans or that are used for specific purposes to limit damage in case of compromise.
   - **Importance:** Using such keys reduces the risk associated with key compromise and ensures that a single compromised key does not affect the entire system.

### 9. **ECU (Electronic Control Unit) Manifest**
   - **Description:** A manifest generated by each ECU, reporting its current software version and any issues encountered.
   - **Importance:** Securing these manifests is vital for accurate reporting and decision-making during updates.

### 10. **Vehicle Version Manifest**
   - **Description:** A collection of manifests from all ECUs in a vehicle, providing a comprehensive overview of the vehicleâ€™s current state.
   - **Importance:** Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of this manifest is crucial for making informed decisions about updates and identifying discrepancies.

### 11. **Uptane Primary ECU**
   - **Description:** The main control unit in the vehicle that manages communication with the Uptane repositories and coordinates updates for secondary ECUs.
   - **Importance:** The primary ECU acts as a gateway for updates and must be secure to prevent unauthorized updates from being distributed to secondary ECUs.

### 12. **Uptane Secondary ECU**
   - **Description:** ECUs that receive updates from the primary ECU; they perform specific functions within the vehicle.
   - **Importance:** Securing secondary ECUs ensures that attackers cannot exploit vulnerabilities in less critical systems to compromise more critical systems.

### 13. **Time Servers**
   - **Description:** Servers that provide accurate time information to ensure the timeliness of updates and prevent rollback attacks.
   - **Importance:** Ensuring the reliability and security of time servers is crucial to prevent outdated or malicious updates.

### 14. **Revocation Mechanisms**
   - **Description:** Systems in place to revoke compromised keys or permissions for roles within the Uptane framework.
   - **Importance:** Effective revocation mechanisms ensure that compromised elements can be quickly neutralized, maintaining the integrity of the update process.

### 15. **Key Storage and Management**
   - **Description:** The infrastructure and practices for securely storing and managing cryptographic keys used in the Uptane system.
   - **Importance:** Protecting key storage is critical to prevent unauthorized access and key compromise.

### 16. **Vehicle-to-Server Communication Protocols**
   - **Description:** The protocols and methods used to communicate between vehicles and Uptane repositories.

### Key:

- **Confidentiality (C):** Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
- **Integrity (I):** Ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and protected from unauthorized modification.
- **Availability (A):** Ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.

### Justification Summary:

- **Confidentiality (C):** Applies to assets where unauthorized disclosure could lead to security breaches, data theft, or privacy violations. Key assets include authentication credentials, sensitive metadata, and user data.
- **Integrity (I):** Applies to assets where unauthorized modification could compromise the security, functionality, or reliability of the system. This is critical for all forms of metadata, firmware, software images, and cryptographic keys.
- **Availability (A):** Applies to assets that must be reliably accessible to ensure proper system functionality and security operations, such as update servers, communication channels, and logging systems.

### Additional Explanation:

- **Not Selecting Confidentiality:** For some assets, confidentiality isn't selected because they don't handle sensitive data directly or the data they manage isn't sensitive in nature (e.g., metadata like snapshot and timestamp metadata). Their primary role is in ensuring the integrity of other processes, not in protecting confidential information.
- **Not Selecting Integrity:** Integrity is always selected unless the asset’s primary function is confidentiality or availability only. Almost all assets need integrity to ensure they function correctly and securely.
- **Not Selecting Availability:** Availability is not critical for assets that are accessed infrequently or only during specific operations (e.g., root metadata, some types of update metadata). These assets don’t need to be highly available at all times but must be secure when they are accessed.

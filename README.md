# Uptane Threat Model

This is an attempt to model a basic OTA implementation and Uptane implementation to help illustrate the benefits of Uptane and to identify things which the Uptane model should consider modifying. The framework used was Microsoft's STRIDE. 


The .xlsx file contains a TARA based on the data flow diagram and threat model shown in the .pdf files. It shows vulnerabilities in the strawman automotive OTA update system that are addressed by Uptane. The .pdf file shows all threats associated with both models.

# List of General OTA Assets (not Uptane specific)

### 1. **Firmware and Software Images**
   - **Description:** The actual firmware or software files being transmitted via OTA updates.
   - **Importance:** Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of these files is critical to prevent malicious software from being installed on devices.

### 2. **Update Server**
   - **Description:** The server from which OTA updates are downloaded.
   - **Importance:** It must be secure to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that only trusted updates are served.

### 3. **Device Authentication Credentials**
   - **Description:** Certificates, keys, or tokens used by the embedded device to authenticate itself to the update server.
   - **Importance:** Protecting these credentials is crucial to prevent impersonation attacks.

### 4. **Update Authentication Credentials**
   - **Description:** Certificates or cryptographic keys used to sign firmware or software updates.
   - **Importance:** Compromising these credentials could allow an attacker to push malicious updates.

### 5. **Communication Channels**
   - **Description:** The network connection (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular, Ethernet) used for transmitting OTA updates.
   - **Importance:** Securing this channel is necessary to protect against data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 6. **Update Client Software**
   - **Description:** The component on the embedded device responsible for managing and applying OTA updates.
   - **Importance:** Ensuring the integrity of this software is crucial as it orchestrates the entire update process.

### 7. **Backup and Recovery Mechanism**
   - **Description:** Systems in place to back up the current firmware and allow for recovery in case of a failed update.
   - **Importance:** These mechanisms are vital for maintaining device operability and preventing bricking.

### 8. **Update Metadata**
   - **Description:** Information about the update, such as version number, release notes, and cryptographic hashes.
   - **Importance:** Integrity of this data ensures that the correct and untampered update is applied.

### 9. **Device Configuration Data**
   - **Description:** Configuration settings stored on the device that may be affected by OTA updates.
   - **Importance:** Protecting this data ensures that device functionality and user settings are not compromised during updates.

### 10. **User Data**
   - **Description:** Any personal or sensitive data stored on the embedded device.
   - **Importance:** Ensuring this data remains confidential and unaltered during OTA updates is essential to user privacy.

### 11. **Logging and Monitoring Systems**
   - **Description:** Logs that track OTA update activities and other security events.
   - **Importance:** Protecting these systems is important for detecting and responding to potential security incidents.

### 12. **Third-party Libraries and Dependencies**
   - **Description:** External software components included in the OTA update.
   - **Importance:** Ensuring these libraries are secure and up-to-date helps protect against vulnerabilities.

### 13. **Cryptographic Keys for Secure Boot**
   - **Description:** Keys used for verifying the authenticity of the device's bootloader and firmware.
   - **Importance:** Protecting these keys ensures the device can only boot trusted firmware, securing the device from tampering.

### 14. **Update Rollout Mechanism**
   - **Description:** System used to manage and control the distribution of OTA updates (e.g., staged rollouts).
   - **Importance:** Ensuring this mechanism is secure prevents unauthorized parties from manipulating update deployment.

### 15. **Rollback Mechanism**
   - **Description:** The ability to revert to a previous version of the firmware if an update causes issues.
   - **Importance:** Protecting this mechanism ensures that rollback cannot be exploited to revert to a vulnerable firmware version.

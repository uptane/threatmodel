## STRIDE Analysis for Basic OTA Assets

### Asset 1: Firmware and Software Images

1. **Spoofing Identity**
   - **Threat:** An attacker might attempt to spoof the identity of the legitimate update source and trick devices into downloading and installing firmware from a malicious source.
   - **Mitigation:** Use digital signatures and certificates to verify the identity of the source before accepting and applying the update. Employing cryptographic mechanisms ensures that only firmware signed by a trusted entity is installed.

2. **Tampering with Data**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could modify the firmware or software images during transmission or while they are stored on the update server, injecting malicious code.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures to ensure the integrity of firmware. Devices should verify these signatures and hashes before installation to confirm that the firmware has not been altered.

3. **Repudiation**
   - **Threat:** The update source could deny that it provided a particular firmware version, or a device could deny receiving and applying a particular update.
   - **Mitigation:** Maintain secure logging and auditing mechanisms on both the update server and devices. These logs should be tamper-proof and include details of all firmware updates, including their sources and checksums.

4. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Threat:** Unauthorized access to firmware images could lead to the disclosure of proprietary code or algorithms, potentially revealing vulnerabilities or intellectual property.

3. **Repudiation**
   - **Threat:** Either the vehicle or server could deny having sent or received specific data, complicating the ability to trace actions and enforce accountability.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement secure logging on both the vehicle and server to record all communications, including timestamps and data payloads. Use digital signatures to ensure that logs are tamper-proof and can serve as reliable evidence.

4. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Threat:** Unauthorized access to vehicle-to-server communications could expose sensitive information, such as vehicle status, location, user data, or system vulnerabilities.
   - **Mitigation:** Encrypt all communications using strong encryption standards to protect data confidentiality. Use secure protocols like TLS and implement access controls to limit who can view or intercept communications.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could flood the communication channel with requests or malicious traffic, disrupting the communication between the vehicle and server, potentially preventing updates or critical commands.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, traffic filtering, and anomaly detection to manage and mitigate potential DoS attacks. Use redundant communication channels and load balancing to ensure continued service availability.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**
   - **Threat:** Compromising the communication protocol could allow an attacker to escalate privileges, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive data or control over vehicle functions.
   - **Mitigation:** Use secure communication protocols with built-in access controls and authentication. Regularly audit communication channels for signs of unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts. Enforce the principle of least privilege to limit access to sensitive commands and data.

### Asset 23: Time Servers

1. **Spoofing Identity**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could impersonate a legitimate time server, providing incorrect time information to devices, which could be used to bypass security checks or facilitate rollback attacks.
   - **Mitigation:** Use authentication mechanisms such as Network Time Security (NTS) to verify the identity of time servers. Devices should be configured to accept time updates only from trusted, authenticated sources.

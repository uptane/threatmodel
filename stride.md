STRIDE is a model for identifying computer security threats. It stands for:
- **S**poofing identity
- **T**ampering with data
- **R**epudiation
- **I**nformation disclosure
- **D**enial of service
- **E**levation of privilege

## STRIDE Analysis for Basic OTA Assets

### Asset 1: Firmware and Software Images

1. **Spoofing Identity**
   - **Threat:** An attacker might attempt to spoof the identity of the legitimate update source and trick devices into downloading and installing firmware from a malicious source.
   - **Mitigation:** Use digital signatures and certificates to verify the identity of the source before accepting and applying the update. Employing cryptographic mechanisms ensures that only firmware signed by a trusted entity is installed.

2. **Tampering with Data**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could modify the firmware or software images during transmission or while they are stored on the update server, injecting malicious code.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures to ensure the integrity of firmware. Devices should verify these signatures and hashes before installation to confirm that the firmware has not been altered.

3. **Repudiation**
   - **Threat:** The update source could deny that it provided a particular firmware version, or a device could deny receiving and applying a particular update.
   - **Mitigation:** Maintain secure logging and auditing mechanisms on both the update server and devices. These logs should be tamper-proof and include details of all firmware updates, including their sources and checksums.

4. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Threat:** Unauthorized access to firmware images could lead to the disclosure of proprietary code or algorithms, potentially revealing vulnerabilities or intellectual property.
   - **Mitigation:** Encrypt firmware images both at rest (on the server) and in transit (over the network). Access controls should restrict who can retrieve and view firmware files.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could try to disrupt the distribution of firmware updates, making it impossible for devices to receive necessary updates.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting and monitoring to detect and prevent DoS attacks on the update server. Use redundancy and multiple update servers to ensure availability.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**
   - **Threat:** If an attacker compromises firmware, they could escalate their privileges, gaining unauthorized access to device functions or data.
   - **Mitigation:** Utilize secure boot mechanisms to ensure that only authorized firmware can be executed. Firmware should run with the least privilege necessary, and there should be mechanisms to detect and respond to unauthorized privilege escalations.
Great! Let's proceed with a STRIDE analysis for the next asset.

### Asset 2: Update Server

1. **Spoofing Identity**
   - **Threat:** An attacker might attempt to spoof the update server, making devices believe they are communicating with the legitimate server while connecting to a malicious one instead.
   - **Mitigation:** Use strong authentication mechanisms such as TLS certificates to verify the identity of the update server. Devices should only connect to servers with verified and trusted certificates.

2. **Tampering with Data**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could intercept and modify the data being sent to or from the update server, potentially altering the firmware images or metadata.
   - **Mitigation:** Ensure that all communications between the device and the update server are encrypted using strong protocols like TLS. Implement integrity checks such as digital signatures to detect any tampering with firmware or metadata.

3. **Repudiation**
   - **Threat:** The update server could deny sending a particular firmware update, or devices could deny receiving it.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement logging on both the server and devices to track updates. Secure logs should record details of all update transactions, including timestamps, versions, and cryptographic checksums.

4. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Threat:** Sensitive information could be exposed if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the update server, including firmware images, cryptographic keys, or update schedules.
   - **Mitigation:** Use encryption for data storage on the server and limit access to sensitive information. Implement strict access controls and authentication to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could overload the update server with requests, making it unavailable to legitimate devices attempting to download updates.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, traffic filtering, and load balancing to manage server traffic. Use distributed update servers and CDN (Content Delivery Network) strategies to reduce the impact of a DoS attack.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**
   - **Threat:** If an attacker compromises the update server, they could escalate privileges and gain control over the distribution of updates, potentially pushing malicious firmware.
   - **Mitigation:** Isolate the server's critical functions and enforce the principle of least privilege. Regularly update and patch the server software to protect against known vulnerabilities, and use robust intrusion detection systems to monitor for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

### Asset 3: Device Authentication Credentials

1. **Spoofing Identity**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could steal device authentication credentials (e.g., certificates, keys, or tokens) and use them to impersonate a legitimate device, gaining unauthorized access to the update server.
   - **Mitigation:** Store authentication credentials securely on the device, using hardware-based security modules such as TPM (Trusted Platform Module) or HSM (Hardware Security Module). Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.

2. **Tampering with Data**
   - **Threat:** An attacker might attempt to alter device authentication credentials, potentially redirecting updates or gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data.
   - **Mitigation:** Use cryptographic techniques to protect the integrity of credentials. Employ secure storage and access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modification.

3. **Repudiation**
   - **Threat:** A device could deny having received or presented certain authentication credentials, complicating the audit and accountability process.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement secure logging mechanisms to track the use of authentication credentials. Logs should be tamper-proof and provide evidence of credential usage and verification attempts.

4. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Threat:** Unauthorized access to device authentication credentials could expose sensitive information, enabling an attacker to impersonate devices or intercept updates.
   - **Mitigation:** Encrypt credentials in storage and during transmission. Use access controls and monitor access to credential storage areas. Employ secure key management practices.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - **Threat:** An attacker could launch a DoS attack against the system managing device authentication credentials, preventing legitimate devices from authenticating and receiving updates.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for authentication servers. Use rate limiting and anomaly detection to prevent overloading authentication services.

6. **Elevation of Privilege**
   - **Threat:** If an attacker obtains device authentication credentials, they could potentially escalate privileges within the update system, gaining unauthorized access to restricted areas or functions.
   - **Mitigation:** Limit the scope and permissions associated with each set of credentials. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that devices only have access to functions and data necessary for their operation. Regularly rotate credentials and audit their use.
